The Jagannath programming language incorporates concepts from:

1. ACADEMIC RESEARCH
   ─────────────────

   Pāṇini's Aṣṭādhyāyī (4th century BCE)
     The foundational grammar of Sanskrit, providing the theoretical basis
     for morphological type encoding and formal language specification.

   Rishi Rajpopat's Cambridge Research (2022)
     "In Pāṇini We Trust: Discovering the Algorithm for Rule Conflict
     Resolution in the Aṣṭādhyāyī"
     Applied for right-to-left affix processing in type resolution.

   Paul Kiparsky's Stanford Research
     Computational linguistics research on Pāṇinian grammar.
     Influenced the design of the Sanskrit morphological analyzer.

   Gerard Huet's Sanskrit Heritage Platform (INRIA)
     Computational Sanskrit tools and sandhi analysis algorithms.
     Reference implementation for junction rules.

2. PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEMS
   ────────────────────

   Nyāya Darśana (Logic & Epistemology)
     Gautama's सूत्र, c. 2nd century BCE
     4 pramāṇas (valid means of knowledge) → Type inference methods

   Sāṃkhya Darśana (Enumeration Philosophy)
     Attributed to Kapila, c. 6th century BCE
     25 tattvas → 25 compilation stages

   Yoga Darśana (Union Philosophy)
     Patañjali's Yoga Sūtras, c. 2nd century BCE
     Ashtanga (8 limbs) → Software development lifecycle

   Vedānta Darśana (End of Knowledge)
     Śaṅkarācārya's Advaita, c. 8th century CE
     Non-dual consciousness → Memory model (Jīva = Ātman = Brahman)

   Garuda Purana
     Traditional Hindu scripture
     28 Narakas (hells) → Error classification taxonomy

   Jyotiṣa Śāstra (Vedic Astrology)
     Traditional astronomical/astrological system
     9 Grahas, 27 Nakṣatras → Temporal optimization patterns

SANSKRIT TRANSLITERATION
================================================================================

This project uses IAST (International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration)
for all Sanskrit terms. Key symbols:

   ā ī ū    Long vowels
   ṛ ṝ ḷ    Vocalic r/l
   ṃ        Anusvāra (nasal)
   ḥ        Visarga
   ṅ ñ ṇ n  Nasals (velar, palatal, retroflex, dental)
   ṭ ḍ ṇ    Retroflexes
   ś ṣ s    Sibilants (palatal, retroflex, dental)

TRADEMARK NOTICE
================================================================================

"Jagannath" (जगन्नाथ) refers to a form of the Hindu deity Vishnu/Krishna,
particularly worshipped at the Jagannath Temple in Puri, Odisha, India.

The use of this name for the programming language is intended as a tribute
to the concept of "Lord of the Universe" (jagat + nātha), reflecting the
language's ambitious goal of unifying ancient wisdom with modern computing.

No trademark claim is made on the religious/cultural term "Jagannath."
